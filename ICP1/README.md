# Write brief explanation here:

1. Text Classification
	* Understood the dataset fetch_20Groups 
	* Performed Multinominal Navie Bayes Test classification which is specifically used for multi dimensional distributed data
	* Implemented SVM and KNN on data and generated respective classification reports. This involved deriving training data, testing data, fitting, transforming, and predicting on Test Data
	* Implemented SVM with bigram and noticed better accuracy than normal SVM.
	* Implemented KNN with removing stop words and noticed better accuracy than normal KNN with respect to accuracy scores
	* SVM has taken more time than KNN in terms of execution speed. As the data is text, GPU could not help much in speed with the process.

2. Natural Language Processing on WEB Url by extracting paragraphs and performing NLP tasks
	* Read the data from the URL with proper headers and store data in the file.
	* Fetched the stored info from the file and performed.
		Tokenization, 
		POS, 
		Stemming, 
		Lemmatization, 
		Trigram, 
		Named Entity Recognition
	* Plot the Frequencies of words after removing the stop words.
	* Each involved in understanding the core concepts of NLP in a structured format.
